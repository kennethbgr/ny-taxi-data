# ny-taxi-data
Data engineering project working with New York City taxi data (inspired by DataTalksClub- Data Engineering Course)



# Setup
I will be using Docker to containerize and run Airflow, etc.

- Built the infrastructure of Google Cloud Platform using Terraform.
- Built the DAGs to ingest data and upload it to Google Cloud Storage (Data Lake) as a parquet file
- Used Airflow to manage the workflows.
