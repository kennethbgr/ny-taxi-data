# ny-taxi-data
Data engineering project working with New York City taxi data (inspired by DataTalksClub- Data Engineering Course)



# Setup
I will be using Docker to containerize and run Airflow, etc.

Built the infrastructure of Google Cloud Platform using Terraform.
Built the DAGs to ingest data and used Airflow to manage the workflows.
